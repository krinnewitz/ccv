1. Description
==============
This is an implementation of color coherence vectors as described in 
http://www.labiem.cpgei.ct.utfpr.edu.br/Members/humberto/disciplinas/pdi/papers/comparingimagesusingcolor.pdf 

It uses OpenCV and there may be implementations with a much better performance.
The main purpose is to evaluate how successful this method can be used in the
context of texture application in 3d reconstructions.

2. Requirements
===============
You need to have a recent version of OpenCV installed. 

3. Compiling
============
A makefile will follow shortly. In the meantime you can compile the software 
by entering g++ -o ccv Main.cpp -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui
