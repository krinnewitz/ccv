1. Description
==============
This is an implementation of color coherence vectors as described in 
http://www.labiem.cpgei.ct.utfpr.edu.br/Members/humberto/disciplinas/pdi/papers/comparingimagesusingcolor.pdf 

It uses OpenCV and there may be implementations with a much better performance.
The main purpose is to evaluate how successful this method can be used in the
context of texture application in 3d reconstructions.

2. Requirements
===============
You need to have a recent version of OpenCV installed. 

3. Compiling
============
You can compile the program by entering the following commands on the command line:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
